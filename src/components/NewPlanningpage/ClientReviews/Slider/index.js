    review: "I have been customer of fintoo for last 10 months and I must say that am absolutely delighted with your service. It is really refreshing to work with Ms Harjas Kaur, my financial adviser who is truly interested in their client’s needs, circumstances and preferences. What really impressed me was the way you took the time to get a feeling for where I was at, your depth of knowledge, lateral thinking and your common sense approach. Your professional, ethical and caring demeanour elicits my trust and respect and I gladly recommend your services whenever possible.",

    review: "I have been using Fintoo for the last four years. During 2020 pandemic setback our net worth had eroded and we were in for a shock. But our advisor Mr Koser advises us to maintain calm, to be patient and with his good effort resurrected the portfolio and it has almost come to pre-pandemic level. Our retirement savings got 'saved' thanks to Koser. Thanks a lot, our advisor-friend.",
