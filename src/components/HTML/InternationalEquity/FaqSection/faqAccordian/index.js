                When investing in US stock markets, you can buy fraction of
                stocks. It is a very unique feature. Basically it means, you
                could own 0.05 of Apple stock. It implies that you don't have to
                think in terms of "how many shares should I buy? Instead, decide
                to invest a certain amount of money and the number of units will
                be allocated to you automatically. For instance, if a stock is
                valued at $158 and you decide to invest $100 in it, you will get
                0.63 shares. Many popular US stocks are more expensive than
                typical Indian stocks. So this feature lets you invest in these
                companies and build a decent diversified portfolio even with
                small amounts of money.

                Yes, tax needs to be paid on Foreign dividend both in US and
                India. However, an Indian Resident individual can claim Tax
                credit of taxes paid in US by virtue of Double Taxation
                Avoidance Agreement (DTAA) entered into between India and US by
                filing a return of income in India. Maximum credit that can be
                availed is the amount of tax that should have been paid in India
                on the transaction if there is no DTAA.

                No, the tax incidence is on the event of transfer of securities
                by the Client. The remittance of any funds lying outside India
                has no connection with the tax incidence.

                Currently, you can invest up to USD 250,000 every year in
                foreign stocks from India. This amount can change, subject to
                RBI guidelines. So your investments in US securities are also
                governed by the same limit.
